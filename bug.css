This error occurs when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a class that also uses other Tailwind directives or custom CSS.  The order of directives seems to be affecting the outcome, causing unintended styles. For example, combining `@apply` with responsive modifiers or pseudo-selectors might lead to unexpected results, specifically the unexpected removal or omission of the applied styles. This is not consistently reproducible, making debugging challenging. The issue is intermittent and depends on the combination of directives used.
