# Intermittent @apply Directive Issue in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates an intermittent issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive in conjunction with other directives or modifiers.  The problem manifests as the unexpected removal or absence of styles applied via `@apply`, seemingly dependent on the order of directives in the class definition.

The issue is not consistently reproducible across different setups, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.  This repository aims to provide a reproducible example and potential solutions to mitigate this behavior.

## Reproducing the Issue

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies (if necessary).
3. Run the build process (if applicable).
4. Observe the styles in the browser. You may need to experiment with different class combinations or directive orders to trigger the erratic behavior.

## Potential Solutions

The provided `bugSolution.css` file offers a potential workaround to ensure consistent styling. This might involve reorganizing the directives in the CSS or using an alternative approach to applying styles.

## Further Investigation

While this repository provides a possible solution, further investigation may be needed to fully understand the underlying cause of this intermittent behavior in Tailwind CSS.  Feel free to contribute to this repository by providing more reproducible examples, potential fixes, or additional insights.
